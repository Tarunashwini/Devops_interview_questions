Let's break down how caching works in your workflow.

### Cache Naming and Storage

The cache is not stored under a simple name. Instead, it's identified by a unique **cache key** that you define in your workflow. In your case, the keys are:

* `go-mod-cache`: The key is **`${{ runner.os }}-go-mod-${{ hashFiles('**/go.sum') }}`**.
* `go-tool-cache`: The key is **`${{ runner.os }}-go-tool-${{ hashFiles('go.mod') }}`**.

These keys create a unique identifier for the cache. For example, a key might look like `ubuntu-latest-go-mod-f2a8c3d1e9f4b6c8d0`. This ensures that a specific set of dependencies gets a specific cache.

The cache files themselves are stored in a **remote, centralized cache service** maintained by GitHub. They are not permanently stored on the local machine (`ubuntu-latest`) that runs your job.

### How Caching Works

Caching is a three-step process: restore, save, and retrieve.

#### 1. Restoring the Cache

When a job starts, the `actions/cache` action first tries to **restore** a cache. It does this by looking for a cache entry that matches your defined `key` or one of the `restore-keys`.

* **Cache Hit**: If a matching cache is found, the action downloads the compressed cache files from GitHub's central service and extracts them into the specified `path` on the runner (e.g., `~/.cache/go-build` and `~/go/pkg/mod`). The `cache-hit` output is set to `true`.
* **Cache Miss**: If no matching cache is found, the action simply moves on. The `cache-hit` output is `false`, and your subsequent commands (`go mod tidy`, `go install`, `go build`) will run from scratch, downloading all dependencies.

#### 2. Building and Installing

After the restore step, your workflow continues. Regardless of whether a cache hit occurred or not, your scripts will run.

* **On a cache hit**: Your `go mod tidy` and `go install` commands will run extremely fast because the required files are already present in the cache directories.
* **On a cache miss**: The commands will run as normal, downloading and compiling everything, populating the cache directories on the runner.

#### 3. Saving the Cache

The final part of the process happens after the main job steps are complete. The `actions/cache/save` step is designed to **save** the newly populated cache.

* The `if` condition `if: steps.go-mod-cache.outputs.cache-hit != 'true'` is crucial here. It ensures the cache is **only saved if it was a cache miss initially**. This prevents you from re-uploading a cache that already exists.
* The action takes the files from the specified `path` on the runner, compresses them, and uploads them to the GitHub cache service under the new `key` (which reflects the updated `go.sum` or `go.mod`).

This process ensures that a successful run with new dependencies creates a new cache entry, making future runs much faster.
